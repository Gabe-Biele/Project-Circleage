# Project-Circleage
First there was Lineage, then there was Archeage. Now there is Circleage!

Project Circleage is an indie MMO Game being developed by Biele Studios. Circleage hopes to capture and reinvent many design elements from old-school Pre-WoW MMOs. Such as...

1) A community-centric design versus a player-centric design. Rather than developing a quest and single-player story driven game, gameplay mechanisms will be structured around making the world feel truly massive and immersive.

2) A Simple UI. Players should be looking at the environment, the details, and the world around them rather than at meters, scales, bars, tables, and graphs. 

3) An emphasis on seamlessness. No instances. No Quests.
