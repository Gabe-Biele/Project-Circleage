# Project-Circleage
First there was Lineage, then there was Archeage. Now there is Circleage!

Project Circleage is an indie MMO Game being developed by Biele Studios. Circleage hopes to capture and reinvent many design elements from old-school Pre-WoW MMOs. Such as...

1) A community-centric design versus a player-centric design. Rather than developing a quest and single-player story driven game, gameplay mechanisms will be structured around making the world feel truly massive and immersive.

2) A Simple UI. Players should be looking at the environment, the details, and the world around them rather than at meters, scales, bars, tables, and graphs. 

3) An emphasis on seamlessness. No instances. No Quests.


Some Game Ideas Below:

Society System:
Individual Player -> Clan (Group of Players) -> Nation (Group of Clans) -> Country (Nation that holds land)

Types of Settlements:
Village, Town (A larger village with a Stronghold nearby)

Stronghold System:
Camp -> Garrison -> Fortress -> Castle -> Citadel

The game world will be divided into territories; Each territory will have 1 Town in it protected by a near by Stronghold. This Stronghold determines the overall ruler of the Territory. Every two weeks, there will be a server wide war for 4 hours where towns, castle towns, and castles may be taken or lost. If a Country controls all Villages as well as the Town and Stronghold in a single territory by the end of the siege, that Country can determine many features of that territory.
